I currently study in [KAIST EE](https://ee.kaist.ac.kr/en/) as a Master student.

From March 2023, I work at [Multimodal AI Lab ](https://mmai.io/) under the supervision of [Prof. Joon Son Chung](https://mmai.io/joon/).

I am now working on TTS, audio generation, and interest in modern generative models. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [tandat.kaist@kaist.ac.kr](mailto:tandat.kaist@kaist.ac.kr).
